{"name":"PyTimer","tagline":"A very simpler timer script. ","body":"PyTimer\r\n======\r\n\r\nPyTimer is a simple timeout module. Given a start time and duration it can be querried whenever needed to determine if the elapsed time has passed. It can also easily be called multiple times to run multiple timers. \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-----\r\n\r\nInstall PyTimer.py into your site-packages directory. \r\n\r\n\r\nStarting a Timer\r\n----------\r\nThe initial call should include the first letter of the desired unit of time. Possible units are seconds, minutes, or hours:\r\n\r\n    >>> clock = Timer(unit)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start the timer give a duration:\r\n\r\n    >>> clock.start(duration)\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck the timeout status\r\n------------------------\r\nCheck the status of the timer. It returns either ```True``` or ```False```. If True the timer has finished:\r\n\r\n    >>> clock.accepted\r\n\r\nUpdates ```clock.accepted```, done once when ```clock.start``` is called. This must be called every time the status needs to be checked:\r\n\r\n    >>> clock.test()","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
